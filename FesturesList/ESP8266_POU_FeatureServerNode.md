🧠 Concept: ESP as a Feature Node

Instead of mining for proof-of-work, the ESP:

- ✅ Receives a task (e.g. “evaluate this math expression”)
- ✅ Performs the computation locally
- ✅ Returns the result to the server
- ✅ Gets rewarded (e.g. WorkTokens) for correct, timely delivery

---

🔧 Example: Distributed Calculator Node

1. Server issues a task
`json
{
  "task_id": "abc123",
  "type": "calc",
  "expression": "sqrt(144) + 7 * 3"
}
`

2. ESP evaluates it
`cpp
float result = sqrt(144) + 7 * 3; // = 12 + 21 = 33
`

3. ESP submits result
`json
{
  "task_id": "abc123",
  "wallet": "0x...",
  "result": 33
}
`

4. Server verifies and rewards
- ✅ Matches expected result
- ✅ Within time limit (e.g. 30s)
- ✅ Not previously solved

🔐 Why This Is More Secure

| Feature | Hash Mining | Feature Node |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Effort | Brute-force | Purposeful computation |
| Abuse resistance | Low (easy to spoof) | High (requires correct logic) |
| Utility | None (burns CPU) | Real (offloads server work) |
| Reward fairness | Based on luck | Based on correctness |

🛠️ Features You Could Offload to ESP Nodes

- 🧮 Math evaluation (calc, trig, modular arithmetic)
- 🔐 Hashing or encoding (SHA3, base64, HMAC)
- 📦 Compression or checksum validation
- 🧩 Puzzle solving (e.g. Sudoku, logic gates)
- 📡 Sensor-based tasks (if ESP has peripherals)

🧱 Architecture Sketch

`plaintext
[User selects feature] → [Server issues task] → [ESP solves + submits] → [Server verifies + rewards]
`

You could even build a task queue or distributed bounty board where ESPs compete to solve tasks fastest and most accurately.

- A sample ESP8266 sketch for task polling and result submission
- A PHP endpoint to issue and verify tasks
- A reward system that scales with task complexity
