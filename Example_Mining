Creating a simple web3 mining app in Python involves setting up a script that interacts with a blockchain network, such as Ethereum, to mine blocks. For simplicity, this script will use the Web3.py library, which provides a way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

To begin, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install Web3.py using pip:

```bash
pip install web3
```

Here's a simple example of a Python script that connects to an Ethereum node and attempts to mine a block:

```python
from web3 import Web3
import time

# Connect to the Ethereum node
infura_url = 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(infura_url))

# Check if connected to the node
if not web3.isConnected():
    raise Exception("Could not connect to Ethereum node")

# Address and private key of the miner (for simplicity, use a dummy example)
miner_address = 'YOUR_MINER_ADDRESS'
private_key = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'

# Function to mine a block
def mine_block():
    nonce = web3.eth.getTransactionCount(miner_address)
    tx = {
        'nonce': nonce,
        'to': miner_address,
        'value': 0,
        'gas': 21000,
        'gasPrice': web3.toWei('50', 'gwei'),
        'data': web3.toHex(text='mining block')
    }

    signed_tx = web3.eth.account.signTransaction(tx, private_key)
    tx_hash = web3.eth.sendRawTransaction(signed_tx.rawTransaction)
    return tx_hash

# Main mining loop
def main():
    print("Starting mining...")
    while True:
        try:
            tx_hash = mine_block()
            print(f"Block mined, transaction hash: {tx_hash.hex()}")
            time.sleep(10)  # Pause for a while before mining the next block
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
            time.sleep(10)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Connecting to the Ethereum Node**: The script connects to an Ethereum node via Infura. You'll need to replace `YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Infura project ID.

2. **Checking the Connection**: It verifies if the connection to the node is successful.

3. **Mining Function**: The `mine_block` function constructs a dummy transaction to the miner's address, signs it with the miner's private key, and sends it to the network.

4. **Main Mining Loop**: The script enters a loop where it continuously mines blocks by calling the `mine_block` function, waits for a while, and then mines the next block. If an error occurs, it prints the error and continues after a short delay.

### Notes:
- **Security**: Never hard-code your private key in the script. Use secure methods to handle private keys.
- **Real Mining**: This script demonstrates the concept but does not perform actual proof-of-work mining. Real mining requires significant computational power and specialized hardware.
- **Network**: For simplicity, this example uses the Ethereum mainnet. You might want to test on a testnet like Ropsten or Rinkeby during development.

By running this script, you'll simulate the process of mining blocks on the Ethereum network in a very basic form. For actual mining, more sophisticated approaches and setups are necessary.
