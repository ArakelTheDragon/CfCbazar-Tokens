# WorkTokenStable Token White Paper
WorkToken (WTK) — Whitepaper

**Overview**

WorkToken (WTK) is a decentralized BEP-20 token built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), designed to facilitate a transparent, community-driven ecosystem with utility in gaming, marketplaces, and smart deals. The WorkToken smart contract is upgradeable using OpenZeppelin’s UUPS proxy pattern, ensuring flexibility and long-term adaptability.
Vision

Our vision is to create a token that powers a diverse platform, including games, marketplaces, and decentralized applications, where users can buy, sell, stake, and trade seamlessly, fostering community engagement and value growth. We aim for unifying the price of labour in different regions for different services, products and professions.

**Tokenomics**

    Token Name: WorkToken

    Symbol: WTK

    Network: Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

    Decimals: 18

    Total Supply: Dynamic (minted/burned on buy/sell)

    Buy Mechanism: Users buy WTK by sending BNB to the contract, which mints tokens based on a dynamic market price.

    Sell Mechanism: Users sell WTK back to the contract, which burns tokens and sends BNB at a discounted sell price.

    Reserve Address: Holds the BNB backing the token liquidity.

    Recycling: Unsold or recycled tokens can be burned to manage supply.

    Upgradeable Contract: Implemented with UUPS proxy to allow future enhancements without losing state.

**Smart Contract Architecture
**
The WorkToken smart contract includes:

    ERC20 Standard Interface: Token balance management, transfers, approvals.

    Upgradeable Proxy (UUPS): Separates logic and storage, enabling secure upgrades.

    Dynamic Pricing: Market price calculation based on BNB reserve and total supply plus a small increment for stability.

    Buy/Sell Functions: Allow users to swap between BNB and WTK with automatic minting and burning.

    Owner Controls: Ability to fund, withdraw, and set market price manually if needed.

    Burn from Recycle: Enables burning of recycled tokens to maintain supply balance.

**User Interaction Flow
**
    Connect Wallet: Users connect with MetaMask or any compatible wallet.

    Switch Network: The DApp will prompt users to switch to the correct BSC network automatically.

    Check Balances: Displays BNB and WTK balances, plus current market price.

    Buy Tokens: Users enter BNB amount and receive WTK minted at market price + 10%.

    Sell Tokens: Users approve and sell WTK back at market price - 10%, receiving BNB.

    Fund & Withdraw: Owner can add or withdraw BNB from the reserve to maintain liquidity.

    Burn Recycled Tokens: Maintain healthy tokenomics by burning tokens from recycling.

**Security Considerations
**
    The contract follows best practices by using OpenZeppelin’s battle-tested libraries.

    Upgradeability is handled securely with UUPS proxy pattern, allowing controlled contract upgrades.

    Owner functions are permissioned and protected.

    Events emitted on key actions (Buy, Sell, Burn, Withdraw) for transparent auditing.

**Roadmap**

    v1.0: Launch on BSC mainnet with buy/sell and upgradeability.

    v1.1: Add mining and VIP purchase features.

    v1.2: Integration with gaming and marketplace dApps.
