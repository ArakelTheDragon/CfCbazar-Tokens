# WorkToken (WTK) â€” Whitepaper

## Overview

WorkToken (WTK) is a decentralized BEP-20 token built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), designed to facilitate a transparent, community-driven ecosystem with utility in gaming, marketplaces, and smart deals.  

The WorkToken smart contract is upgradeable using OpenZeppelinâ€™s UUPS proxy pattern, ensuring flexibility and long-term adaptability.  

**Proxy Contract Address:** `0xecbD4E86EE8583c8681E2eE2644FC778848B237D`  
(Importable into MetaMask as **WTK**)

Our vision is to create a token that powers a diverse platform, including games, marketplaces, and decentralized applications, where users can buy, sell, stake, and trade seamlessly, fostering community engagement and value growth.  

We aim to unify the price of labour across regions and services by using WorkToken and platform credits as a fair medium of exchange.

## Tokenomics

- **Token Name:** WorkToken  
- **Symbol:** WTK  
- **Network:** Binance Smart Chain (BSC)  
- **Decimals:** 18  
- **Total Supply:** Dynamic (minted/burned on buy/sell)  
- **Buy Mechanism:** Users buy WTK by sending BNB to the contract, which mints tokens at a dynamic market price.  
- **Sell Mechanism:** Users sell WTK back to the contract, which burns tokens and sends BNB at a discounted sell price.  
- **Reserve Address:** Holds the BNB backing token liquidity.  
- **Recycling:** Unsold/recycled tokens may be burned to manage supply.  
- **Upgradeable Contract:** Implemented with UUPS proxy for future enhancements.

## Platform Credit System

While WTK is a tradable BEP-20 token, the **CfCbazar platform uses non-withdrawable Platform Credit** as its internal economy.  

### Deposit Rules
- Deposit **BNB** or **WTK** to the platform address:  
  `0xFBd767f6454bCd07c959da2E48fD429531A1323A`  

- Then visit: [https://cfcbazar.ct.ws/buy.php](https://cfcbazar.ct.ws/buy.php)  
  Select the deposited coin (BNB or WTK) and press **Check Deposit**.  

- Conversion:  
  - **1 WorkToken (WTK) â†’ 1 Platform Credit**  
  - **0.00001 BNB â†’ 1 Platform Credit**  

- **Anti-Double Credit:** Each transaction is checked by its hash to prevent duplicate credits.  

### Usage
- **Platform Credit** can unlock premium features, access games, and participate in CfCbazarâ€™s ecosystem.  
- It is **not withdrawable** and serves as utility inside the platform.

- **Buy/Sell Functions:** Automatic minting/burning on swaps.  
- **Owner Controls:** Fund/withdraw reserves, set manual price.
