Got it! Since this README is meant to serve as the GitHub front page for the CfCbazar + WorkToken system, we can make it more general, welcoming, and overview-focused rather than just an API reference. It should explain the ecosystem, how WTK works, and link to the API and other resources. Hereâ€™s a polished version ready for README.md:

# CfCbazar â€” WorkToken (WTK) Ecosystem

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

Welcome to **CfCbazar**, the platform where users can earn, use, and interact with **WorkToken (WTK)**, a decentralized BEP-20 token on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This repository contains documentation, APIs, and tools for integrating CfCbazar and WorkToken into your applications, IoT devices, and web services.

## Overview

**WorkToken (WTK)** powers the CfCbazar ecosystem, which includes:

- **Games** â€” Earn tokens while playing.  
- **Marketplace** â€” Trade tokens and unlock platform features.

## API & Integration

ESP8266 devices and web apps can interact with CfCbazar using the **WorkToken API**:

- **Base URL:** `http://cfcbazar.atwebpages.com/api.php`  
- **Methods:** GET (check tokens), POST (increment tokens)  
- **Rate-limiting:** 1 increment every 5 seconds  
- **Tampering prevention:** Only 0.00001 per increment; wrong values reset tokens

**ESP Example Code:**

```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <ESP8266HTTPClient.h>

void sendToken(const char* email) {
  if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) {
    HTTPClient http;
    http.begin("http://cfcbazar.atwebpages.com/api.php");
    http.addHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
    String postData = "email=" + String(email) + "&tokens=0.00001";
    int httpCode = http.POST(postData);
    if (httpCode > 0) {
      Serial.println(http.getString());
    }
    http.end();
  }
}

Full API documentation can be found in API.md.
