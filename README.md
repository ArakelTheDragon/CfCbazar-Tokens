# CfCbazar Token Ecosystem

This repository contains smart contract metadata, whitepapers, and integration resources for the CfCbazar platform's two core tokens. The WTK WorkToken also called WorkToken Stable and the WorkTHR WorkToken can both be mined with our [`web miner`](https://cfcbazar.42web.io/miner/) which mines other coins(you do not need to care what) and all profits from the mining of other coins goes to fuel the exosystem & the trading pools for WTK and WorkTHR on pancakeswap [`https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=0xecbD4E86EE8583c8681E2eE2644FC778848B237D&outputCurrency=0xffc4f8Bde970D87f324AefB584961DDB0fbb4F00`](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=0xecbD4E86EE8583c8681E2eE2644FC778848B237D&outputCurrency=0xffc4f8Bde970D87f324AefB584961DDB0fbb4F00). We are a 0 budget project and we aim to bring real value to the WorkToken by proof of work.
