## Abstract

**WorkTHR** is a utility token earned through verifiable computational labor. It powers a gamified reward system where users gain tokens by contributing real work via browser-based miners and low-power mining platforms like DuinoCoin. The goal is to democratize mining, encouraging broader participation in decentralized networks.

---

## Problem Statement

Current mining ecosystems often favor users with expensive hardware or technical knowledge. Most tokens lack a tangible tie to user effort, leaving little room for fair contribution-based distribution. Thereâ€™s a gap in the market for a token that equitably rewards individuals based on actual, measurable work.

---

## Solution: WorkTHR

WorkTHR aims to bridge that gap by rewarding users who:
- Mine via a lightweight web-based miner  
- Participate in DuinoCoin mining using a JavaScript/HTML5-based interface  

> *MintMe integration is planned, but not yet live.*

### Core Features:
- **Earn-as-you-work** model  
- **Transparent reward system** via API polling  
- **Gamification** through upgrades, levels, and achievements  
- **Integration-ready token** for web platforms
